26 / 10:
All test using same train and test set
Test set consists of 105,5 hours of sleep

27 / 10 
Choosing model 2 SpO2
Choosing model 2 ECG

28 / 10
Choosing model 11 ECG

29 / 10
Testing model 11 ECG with mfcc + tempogram channels
Result see at report14
Accuracy low
Then
Change to 3 layers of 3 type of discrete cosine transform
=> Better accuracy than temporgram
Choosing 18
Train time: 12.5 minutes

30/10
Change SpO2 -> 3 types of DCT (MFCC) just like ECG
Change SpO2 from model 2 to 3
Add 1 channel to ECG model beside 3DCT which is tempogram
Training model 19 ECG
train time: 17 minutes
Choosing model 19 (better accuracy)
Add tempogram to SpO2
training model 4 SpO2
train time: 1,5 minutes
model 4 SpO2 => Slightly lower accuracy (same test) and more unstable on both class
still using model 3 SpO2
